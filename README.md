What is SQL?
A structured query language (SQL) is a language that is used to operate relational databases. Some of the major ways in which SQL is used in conjunction with a relational database is for the purposes of storing, retrieving, and manipulating data stored in a relational database. Despite being older than other languages, it is still widely used all over the world.
